# Lerverket Frontend #
### About
This is the frontend repo for my project Lerverket, built with React and Typescript. The backend is built with Strapi.

****
### Demo
This is the demo: https://lerverket.netlify.app/

The backend is hosted on Heroku's hobby tier - this means that the Heroku server goes into sleep mode when it is not used. The first time you visit the site it may take a little while to load as the server 'wakes up'. Just refresh the browser and it should be faster.

### Run locally
To run locally, clone repo.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run frontend server
```
npm run start
```
The frontend server will run on http://localhost:3000

### Run backend server
If you haven't already, proceed to run the backend server.
